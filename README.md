# BOGOODSKI-nextjs-tailwind

Practicing with tailwind css and typescript on nextjs by building a new personal site.  Utilizing Daisy UI for design help. 
## Day 2

<p><b>March 31, 2022</b></p>

<p>So, I just came up with this idea.  Probably a poor one, but I want to work through its implementation anyway. </p>
<p>Instead of routing between pages, I'm just going to have screens fade in and out via JavaScript.  It'll probably make saving a link to a specific page a challenge but I'll figure that out later.  Or, rebuild the functionality better way.  I just wanna play around with animations. </p>
