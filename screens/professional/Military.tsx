                <p>FTP'ing HTML to geocities was a thing for me during childhood.  And e-wrestling. Somehow my path to total nerdom derailed, and I spent a handful of years in the Army as a forward observer, deployed to Iraq two times, and spent a few months in South Korea. </p>
                <p>And as a benefit - to which I'm legitimately grateful, the service provided me some spending money during college.  I didn't use it wisely, but it probably got me through my degree at the University of South Florida.</p>
